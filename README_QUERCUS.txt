My leaflet map in R was too big to compile and I had to make an individual HTML with dependent files.

I have put the files and the HTML on my project repository: https://github.com/Tyler-CY/JSC370-Midterm

Instructions were also included in the report. In short, download crime_map_files and crime_map.html and put them in the same directory. Then click crime_map.html to load the interactive map.
